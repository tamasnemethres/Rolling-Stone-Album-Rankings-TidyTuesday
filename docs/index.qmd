### Predicting Album Longevity using Machine Learning and Survival Analysis


**Data Source**: TidyTuesday Rolling Stone Top 500 Albums  
**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, OpenAI API, Lifelines, Pandas

---

## Project Overview

This analysis investigates what characteristics make an album endure on the Rolling Stone Top 500 list over time. Using the Rolling Stone rankings from 2003, 2012, and 2020, I built predictive models to identify factors that contribute to an album's lasting success.

**Key Techniques Used**:
- **LLM-Enhanced Data Imputation**: Using GPT-4 to fill missing genre data <br>
- **Survival Analysis**: Kaplan-Meier estimators for understanding album longevity <br>
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Custom binary indicators and systematic feature selection <br>
- **Robust Cross-Validation**: 20-repeat stratified k-fold validation <br>

**Main Findings**:
- 92% of albums from 2003 remained on the list in 2012 <br>
- 64% of 2003 albums were still ranked in 2020 <br>
- Album type (Studio vs Live) emerged as the strongest predictor <br>
- Genre-specific patterns (Funk/Disco) showed significant predictive power <br>

```{python}
filtered_data = data[data["rank_2003"].notna()].copy()
display(filtered_data)
```

I removed every album that did not exist in 2003.  
Next I create 3 binary variables:  
`billboard_2003`  
`billboard_2012`  
`billboard_2020`  
*With the following values*  
`1` Was on the Billboard  
`0` Was not on Billboard

```{python}
filtered_data["billboard_2003"] = 1 # since every album was on the billboard in 2003  
filtered_data["billboard_2012"] = filtered_data["rank_2012"].notna().astype(int)
filtered_data["billboard_2020"] = filtered_data["rank_2020"].notna().astype(int)
```

For the first analysis I am curious what makes an album a good album, so first I am creating a model from 2003 to 2012, and then based on the results predicting 2020.

Since genre is a very important predictor, and I have missing values, I used GPT to fill in their data.

```{python}
data_for_llm = filtered_data.copy()
```

```{python}
non_missing_data = data_for_llm[data_for_llm["genre"].notna()]
non_missing_data["genre"].value_counts()
```

```{python}
# Find rows with missing values
missing_genre_mask = data_for_llm["genre"].isna()

# Create distinct dataset with only missing values
missing_data = data_for_llm[missing_genre_mask].copy()
genre = non_missing_data["genre"].unique() 
```

```{python}
display(missing_data)
```

```{python}
# load_dotenv()

# # Get API key
# api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# # check
# if not api_key:
#     raise ValueError("API_KEY not found in environment variables")

```

```{python}
# client = OpenAI()

# total_rows = len(missing_data)
# counter = 0

# for index, row in missing_data.iterrows():
#     counter += 1
#     print(f"Processing {counter}/{total_rows}: {row['album']} by {row['clean_name']}")
    
#     response = client.chat.completions.create(
#         model="gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14",
#         messages=[
#             {"role": "system", "content": "You are a music expert. Provide concise and accurate genre classifications for albums based on the given options."},
#             {"role": "user", "content": f"""Based on the album '{row['album']}' and the artist '{row['clean_name']}',

#                         If you don't know the genre, leave it blank.
#                         If the genre is not in the list, write a new one. """}
#         ],
#         max_completion_tokens=20, 
#         temperature=0  
#     )
    
#     response_text = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
#     print(f"Response: {response_text}")
#     missing_data.loc[index, "genre"] = response_text

# display(missing_data)

# #Backup data
# missing_data.to_excel("missing_genre.xlsx", index=False)
```

Since the model is a small model, I check it's accuracy with an LLM-as-a-Judge

```{python}
# missing_data_to_judge = missing_data.copy()
# random_data = missing_data_to_judge.sample(10, random_state=123)

# total_rows = len(random_data)
# counter = 0



# for index, row in random_data.iterrows():
#     counter += 1

#             {"role": "user", "content": f"""A smaller model was given a task to classify the genre of albums,

#                         The genre can be one of the following: {list(genre)}.

#         ],
#         max_completion_tokens=100,

#     parts = response_text.split(':', 1)

#     random_data.loc[index, 'reasoning'] = reasoning

```

```{python}
random_data = pd.read_excel("random_data.xlsx")
display(random_data[["correctness_score", "reasoning"]])
```

Although 3 out of 10 were incorrect, it still got 2 out of 3 correct. Inspecting the reasoning for the score of 2, I decided to move on with the model, since it is just a nuanced difference.

```{python}
missing_data["genre"].value_counts()
```

```{python}
#rs_data = Rolling Stones data 
rs_data =pd.concat([missing_data, non_missing_data], ignore_index=True)
#Backup
rs_data.to_excel("rs_data.xlsx", index=False)
```

```{python}
#Backup
#rs_data= pd.read_excel("rs_data.xlsx")
```

# Survival analysis of the albums

```{python}
# Create survival variables: duration and event
rs_data['duration'] = 0
rs_data['event'] = 0

# Create duration and event for each album
for index, row in rs_data.iterrows():
    if row['billboard_2012'] == 0:
        # Album dropped off between 2003-2012
        rs_data.loc[index, 'duration'] = 9   # 2012 - 2003
        rs_data.loc[index, 'event'] = 1      # Event occurred (dropped off)
    elif row['billboard_2020'] == 0:
        # Album stayed until 2012, but dropped off by 2020
        rs_data.loc[index, 'duration'] = 17  # 2020 - 2003
        rs_data.loc[index, 'event'] = 1      # Event occurred (dropped off)
    else:
        # Album still on Billboard in 2020
        rs_data.loc[index, 'duration'] = 17  # 2020 - 2003
        rs_data.loc[index, 'event'] = 0      # Censored (still alive)

Analysis shows that 92% of the albums that were on the Billboard charts in 2003 were still present in 2012, and nearly 64% of 2003 albums were on the 2020 Billboard charts. But what makes for that success? In the following Logistic Regression models I try to answer this question.

I created a word count for album names, because I am curious if shorter names help albums perform better.

```{python}
for index, rows in rs_data.iterrows():
    words= word_tokenize(rows["album"])
    word_count = len(words)
    rs_data.loc[index, "album_name_word_count"] = word_count


```

```{python}
display(rs_data)
```

```{python}
rs_data["billboard_2012"].value_counts()
```

```{python}
rs_data['type'] = rs_data['type'].replace('Soundtrack', 'Live')
```

```{python}
def group_rare_categories(df, column, min_count=15):
    value_counts = df[column].value_counts()
    rare_categories = value_counts[value_counts < min_count].index
    df_copy = df.copy()
    df_copy[column] = df_copy[column].replace(rare_categories, 'Other')
    return df_copy 

rs_data_new = group_rare_categories(rs_data, 'genre', min_count=15)
ml_data = rs_data_new[["billboard_2012", "release_year", "type", "genre", "album_name_word_count", "artist_gender","debut_album_release_year", "years_between", "artist_member_count"]].dropna()
numeric_features = ["release_year", "album_name_word_count", "debut_album_release_year", "years_between", "artist_member_count"]
categorical_features = ["type","genre", "artist_gender"]
X= ml_data.drop(columns=["billboard_2012"])
y= ml_data["billboard_2012"]

X_train, X_holdout, y_train, y_holdout = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

cv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(
    n_splits=5,
    n_repeats=20,
    random_state=42
) # n_repeats=20, because I want as robust results as possible
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(drop='first', handle_unknown='infrequent_if_exist', min_frequency=2), categorical_features)
    ]
)

# Pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(
    preprocessor,
    LogisticRegression(max_iter=5000)
)

scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X_train, y_train, cv=cv, scoring="roc_auc")
print(scores)





```

```{python}
# Fit the pipeline before making predictions
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Correct way to get ROC-AUC
y_pred_proba = pipeline.predict_proba(X_holdout)[:, 1]  # Probabilities for class 1
holdout_auc = roc_auc_score(y_holdout, y_pred_proba)
print(f"Holdout ROC-AUC: {holdout_auc:.3f}")

# For classification report
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_holdout)  # Hard predictions
print(classification_report(y_holdout, y_pred))
```

Well... The model is not the best... Let's do some feature engineering stuff. 

```{python}
# Your current baseline
baseline_score = 0.498

# Test removing each feature with full CV
current_features = ["release_year", "type", "genre", "album_name_word_count", 
                   "artist_gender", "debut_album_release_year", "years_between", 
                   "artist_member_count"]

print("-" * 50)

feature_removal_results = {}

for feature_to_remove in current_features:
    print(f"Testing removal of: {feature_to_remove}")
    
    # Create feature lists without this feature
    remaining_features = [f for f in current_features if f != feature_to_remove]
    remaining_numeric = [f for f in remaining_features if f in numeric_features]
    remaining_categorical = [f for f in remaining_features if f in categorical_features]
    
    # Skip if we remove all features of a type
    if len(remaining_numeric) == 0 and len(remaining_categorical) == 0:
        print("  Skipping - would remove all features")
        continue
    
    # Create subset of data
    feature_cols = remaining_features + ["billboard_2012"]
    ml_data_subset = ml_data[feature_cols].dropna()

    X_subset = ml_data_subset.drop(columns=["billboard_2012"])
    y_subset = ml_data_subset["billboard_2012"]

    # Create new preprocessor for remaining features
    transformers = []
    if len(remaining_numeric) > 0:
        transformers.append(('num', StandardScaler(), remaining_numeric))
    if len(remaining_categorical) > 0:
        transformers.append(('cat', OneHotEncoder(drop='first', handle_unknown='infrequent_if_exist', min_frequency=2), remaining_categorical))
    
    test_preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(transformers=transformers)
    
    # Create pipeline
    test_pipeline = make_pipeline(
        test_preprocessor,
        LogisticRegression(max_iter=5000)
    )
    
    # Run cross-validation
    X_train_subset, _, y_train_subset, _ = train_test_split(

    )
    
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(test_pipeline, X_train_subset, y_train_subset, cv=cv, scoring="roc_auc")
    mean_score = cv_scores.mean()
    std_score = cv_scores.std()
    
    improvement = mean_score - baseline_score
    feature_removal_results[feature_to_remove] = {
        'mean_score': mean_score,
        'std_score': std_score,
        'improvement': improvement
    }
    
    print(f"  Mean ROC-AUC: {mean_score:.3f} ± {std_score:.3f}")
    print(f"  Change: {improvement:+.3f}")
    print()

# Summary of results
print("=" * 60)
print("SUMMARY - Feature Removal Results:")
print("=" * 60)

# Sort by improvement
sorted_results = sorted(feature_removal_results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['improvement'], reverse=True)

for feature, results in sorted_results:
    status = "🟢 IMPROVE" if results['improvement'] > 0 else "🔴 WORSEN"
    print(f"{status} Remove '{feature}': {results['mean_score']:.3f} ({results['improvement']:+.3f})")

# Identify features to remove
features_to_remove = [feature for feature, results in feature_removal_results.items() 
                     if results['improvement'] > 0.01]  # Improvement > 1%
```

Based on the results I will remove some features. But must all features from the subgroup go? Let's see.

```{python}
# Fit the pipeline to see feature importance
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get feature names after preprocessing
feature_names = pipeline.named_steps['columntransformer'].get_feature_names_out()

# Get coefficients (feature importance for logistic regression)
coefficients = pipeline.named_steps['logisticregression'].coef_[0]

# Create feature importance dataframe
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': feature_names,
    'importance': np.abs(coefficients)
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print("Feature Importance (absolute coefficients):")
print(feature_importance)

# For classification report

```

# Final model- predicting the 2020 dataset

```{python}
#Adding bilboard 2020 data to ml_data_engineered_2
ml_data_engineered_2["billboard_2020"] = rs_data["billboard_2020"].copy()

#Comparing to the actual 2020 billboard presence

print(classification_report(ml_data_engineered_2['billboard_2020'], ml_data_engineered_2['pred_2020']))
```

Based on the model results, it predicts that all albums will be on the Billboard charts. This suggests we cannot predict future success from 2012 data alone. Note that I used only albums that were on the Billboard charts in 2003. There can be other important factors contributing to an album's success that our model doesn't capture. However, we must acknowledge that the data was not sufficient to predict success accurately. The model was also biased, as many more albums remained on the Billboard charts than dropped off. For a more accurate and comprehensive analysis, we need albums that were **not** on the Billboard charts in 2003 to create a more balanced dataset. 

Also note that the original dataset contained albums that were older than 2003. Since I was curious what makes an album great in the long run, newer albums were not within the scope of this analysis.
